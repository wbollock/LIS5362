				<h3>About Matisse</h3>
				<p><img src="images/matisse.jpg" alt="A portrait of Henri Matisse" class="float-right">Henri Matisse was a French artist who is known for his use of vibrant color.
					Matisse lived from 1869 to 1954 and made a huge impact on the art world.
					He was a leading member of the Fauvist movement, which highlighted vibrant colors.
				</p>
				<p>  Later in life, Matisse became ill and could not stand at an easel to paint.
					Instead of giving up, he began experimenting with cutting paper. His paper cutouts
					revolutionized the world modern art. 
				</p>
				<p>Matisse was born in France and first achieved prominence as the leader of the Fauvist movement. 
					This painting movement was marked by the use of bold and brash colors, and often times the colors used to portray
					objects were different from their real life counterparts. For example, in his 1905 painting "The Woman with a Hat" he portrays
					his wife's visage in oranges and greens.
				</p>
				<p>Matisse's contemporaries included the painter Pablo Picasso and writer Gertrude Stein.
					Later in life Matisse was stricken with abdominal cancer and surgery left him confined to a wheelchair.
					He could no longer stand at the easel to paint. Instead, he opted to cut painted pieces of paper
					and arrange them with help from his assitants. He called this new technique "painting with scissors."
				</p>
				<p>In Matisse's final years, he designed the stained glass windows and interior paintings
					of the Chapelle du Rosaire in Vence. He even designed the attire worn by the church leaders.
