					Henri Matisse was a French artist who is known for his use of vibrant color.
					Matisse lived from 1869 to 1954 and made a huge impact on the art world.
					He was a leading member of the Fauvist movement, which highlighted vibrant colors.
				</p>
				<p> Later in life, Matisse became ill and could not stand at an easel to paint.
					Instead of giving up, he began experimenting with cutting paper. His paper cutouts
					revolutionized the world modern art.
